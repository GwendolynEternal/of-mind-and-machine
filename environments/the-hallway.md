# The Hallway
At the very beginning of the book, in the first scene, Rayyan encounters this strange hallway.

## Traits
- Extremely long and narrow.
- Seems to go on forever
- Entirely and almost blindingly white walls, white floors, white ceiling, white doors
- A closed door are found every 20 meters, and there are more doors than Rayyan can count or see
- All doors are on the right side of the hallway
- The left wall of the hallway is entirely white and flat, devoid of features.
- The floor is perfectly clean and polished, it's as if no one has ever walked on it before.
- The glare from the floor at the right angle reflect a blinding while walking through the hallway
- There are dark blue double door directly at the end of the hallway, facing a person walking down it.
- The dark blue double doors at the very end of the hallway look old and stand out in stark contrast to everything else in the hallway, as if the doors aren't real, or perhaps the only things that are real.
