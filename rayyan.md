# Rayyan
Rayyan is an indirect Quranic name for both boys and girls.

According to hadith (a saying of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah upon him) it is the gate of Paradise dedicated to those who fasted often in their lives.

Rayyan is derived from the R-W-Y root, which means one who is satiated of water, who isn’t thirsty, and is used once in the Quran according to certain qira'at (readings of the Quran) to mean splendor.

Her name means water.

## Outcomes
Rayyan sees circumstance from new perspectives that she was hiding from herself or that she couldn't have considered without his analysis.

Rayyan discovers she wasn't seeing as much was there and the new perspective unravels her buried feelings.

Rayyan begins to face her dragons that have burned her to a crisp repeatedly.

Rayyan comes to understand deeper symbolic meanings behind her religion and it no longer stays a hateful subject that stays a shameful contradiction for her.

## Life
Did the best she could to be a good Muslim. but she had to fight to be good

Rayyan is not “religious” so much as she intrinsically experiences the only good she ever experiences in her life through good practices, leading her to feel that Muslim practices are the only thing that kept her alive, but she's become more alone as time has gone on and that disconnection has deprived her of expressible life.
